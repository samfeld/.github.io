    <h2>Lou Malnati's Pizza</h2>
    <p>
        What's a trip to the Chicagoland area without deep dish pizza? 
        If visiting the north shore suburbs of Chicago, Lou Malnati's pizza is a must.
        Lou Malnati started working in Chicago's first deep dish pizzeria in the 1940s. 
        He then opened the first Lou Malnati Pizzeria with his wife in Lincolnwood, IL on March 17, 1971.
        Every Lou Malnati's Pizza is handmade from scratch, using California vine-ripened tomatoes. 
        Lou Malnati's mozarella has been supplied from the same dairy farms for the past 40 years. 
        Known for its  deep dish crust, Lou Malnati's secret crust recipe has been passed down from generation to generation.
